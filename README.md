# MyFirstPerceptron
The basic building block of Machine Learning

This Perceptron (digital Neuron) is the building block of machine learning.
It has 2 inputs and 1 output. In the example, the perceptron can be trained to perform for example an "OR / "AND" gate.

The trainingset in the Perceptron is:
[0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 1]
[1, 0, 1]
[1, 1, 1]

wich represents the "OR" gate. It can easily be modfied to an "AND" gate.

The project is built with Node, and is written in ES6.

Start the project with: "npm start".
